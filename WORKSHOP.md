## Workshop
We split the workshop into separate stages. Each stage is in a separate git branch and you can always checkout to the next stage in case you need to.

We'll go from starting stage to the final stage while coding-along.

- Starting stage - `git checkout workshop-start`
- Stage 1 - `git checkout workshop-1`
- Stage 2 - `git checkout workshop-2`
- Stage 3 - `git checkout workshop-3`
- Stage 4 - `git checkout workshop-4`
- Final stage 5 - `git checkout workshop-5`


You can always check the final stage by running `git checkout workshop-5`.
